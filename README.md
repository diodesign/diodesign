### Hey, you found me.

By day, I [write and edit](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Chris-Williams) articles about enterprise technology. When I'm not working, this is the sort of thing that keeps me occupied:

- 🔭 I’m implementing an RV64I linker in Rust for my Rust-RISC-V bare-metal hypervisor, [diosix](https://github.com/diodesign/diosix). I'm also bringing that project up on real hardware: it's almost fully booting on a SiFive Unleashed board.

- 🌱 I’m learning Mandarin Chinese as a second language. 我正在慢慢学习中文！

- 💬 Ask me about Rust, RISC-V, operating system and hypervisor design, computer security, and professional writing and editing. My [personal website](https://diodesign.co.uk) has some more information about myself and links to things I do.

- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/diodesign) or [email](mailto:chrisw@diosix.org).

- 😄 Pronouns: He and him.
