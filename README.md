### Hey, you found me.

By day, I'm a technical editor. When I'm not working, this is the sort of thing that keeps me occupied:

- ðŸ”­ I'm restarting work on my open-source RISC-V bare-metal hypervisor, [diosix](https://github.com/diodesign/diosix). I want to bring that up on multiple pieces of hardware I have to hand.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about RISC-V, operating system and hypervisor design, computer security, and professional writing and editing. My [personal website](https://diodesign.org) has some more information about myself and links to things I do.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/diodesign.org) or [email](mailto:chrisw@diosix.org).
