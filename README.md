### Hey, you found me.

By day, I [edit](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Chris-Williams) news and feature coverage of IT and enterprise technology. When I'm not working, this is the sort of thing that keeps me occupied:

- 🔭 I'm restarting work on my open-source RISC-V bare-metal hypervisor, [diosix](https://github.com/diodesign/diosix). I want to bring that up on multiple pieces of hardware I have to hand.

- 🌱 I’m learning Mandarin Chinese as a second language. 我正在慢慢学习中文！

- 💬 Ask me about RISC-V, operating system and hypervisor design, computer security, and professional writing and editing. My [personal website](https://diodesign.org) has some more information about myself and links to things I do.

- 📫 How to reach me: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/diodesign.org) or [email](mailto:chrisw@diosix.org).
