### Hey, you found me.

By day, I write and edit articles about enterprise technology. When I'm not working, this is the sort of thing that keeps me occupied:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m impementing a filesystem for my Rust-RISC-V bare-metal hypervisor, [diosix](https://github.com/diodesign/diosix), so that it can locate, load, and run native services that interact with subsequently loaded guest operating systems. There's a project page [here](https://github.com/users/diodesign/projects/1) with to-do items and long-term plans.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning:
  - Chinese as a second language
  - How to configure, simulate, and verify FPGA and ASIC designs using nMigen, SystemVerilog, and related tooling

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with porting diosix to other CPU architectures, such as OpenPower and Arm, and I will need help with device drivers and building a user interface to manage the hypervisor and its guests.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Rust, RISC-V, operating system and hypervisor design, computer security, and professional writing and editing. My [personal website](https://diodesign.co.uk) has some more information about myself and links to things I do.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/diodesign) or [email](mailto:diodesign@tuta.io).

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He and him.
